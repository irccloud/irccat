# This is a multi-part build that first statically builds irccat, and then
# copies over the resulting binary and the default SSL root certs over into
# a 'scratch' image, resulting in a very small image.
#
# You must provide a config file at /etc/irccat.[json|yaml|toml|hcl], for
# example:
#
#  docker build . -t irccat
#  docker run -d -P -v /path/to/my/config/irccat.json:/etc/irccat.json irccat
#
# (This will also expose the default ports: 12345 and 8045.)

# Step one: fetch deps and build
